# Tyson documentation

If you are looking for user documentation, we recommend you start by reading the [General docs](./general.md).
After that, if you want additional information specifically about the CLI or Node API, you can refer to the [CLI docs](./cli.md) or [Node API docs](./nodeApi.md), respectively.

If you are looking to contribute, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./general.md).
